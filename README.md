## this is a telegram bot which owoifies messages

after downloading go into the folder and do a 

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

then just paste the token you got from BotFather into the TOKEN file and type

`$ python owobot.py`

- to use the bot just reply to a message with /owo

### future plans and other stuff I probably wont do because I'm too lazy:

- add an owo gif thingy

- do something to when /owo doesnt reply to a message

- loose weight/do sports
