## this is a telegram bot which owoifies messages

### installing the way it should work:


`$ git clone https://github.com/Bekay1211/owoBot`

`$ cd owoBot`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

then just paste the token you got from BotFather into the TOKEN file and type

`$ python owobot.py`

### if this for some reason just doesnt work:

For some reason my pi refuses to use python3 and i just couldt get that to work.
Luckyli there is litterally only one thing you need to have for this to work which is python telegram bot git

`$ sudo git clone https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot --recursive`

`$ cd python-telegram-bot`

`$ sudo python3 setup.py install`

`$ cd owoBot`

then just paste the token you got from BotFather into the TOKEN file and type

`$ python owobot.py`

## how to use the bot:

- to use the bot just reply to a message with /owo

### future plans and other stuff I probably wont do because I'm too lazy:

- add an owo gif thingy

- do something to when /owo doesnt reply to a message

- loose weight/do sports
